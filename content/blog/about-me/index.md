Hi! My name is Jay, I am currently enrolled in Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo.
Initially, I have always had a great intereset in computers. This outlet of curioustity fueled my motivation to persue a path of further knowledge in the field of Computer Engineering. Over many years of schooling thus far, I have found myself to be dedicated, eager, innovative, and goal-oriented. Finally, some of my hobbies include playing/coding video games, watching movies and composing music.
