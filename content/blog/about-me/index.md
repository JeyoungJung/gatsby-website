Hi! My name is Jay, and I am currently a 1B Computer Engineering student at University of Waterloo.
My interest in Computers made me want to learn about it more which is why I chose Computer Engineering.
Also, to list some of my hobbies, I like to play video games, and enjoy watching movies.

And also LaTeX functions using the [KaTeX plugin][katex-plugin]: $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$

You can even [link files for download](hello_world.zip)
